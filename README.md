# Method-of-Manufactured-Solutions
This method for verification is used for problems for which analytical solutions could not be found. Verification of the implementation of numerical methods for solving the convection diffusion problem with variable coefficients and Neumann boundary conditions
Performed verification of implementation of numerical methods for solving convection-diffusion equations with increasing order of complexity. 
1. Verification of solution for convection diffusion equation without first and zero order terms with constant coefficients and Dirichlet boundary conditions
2. Verification of solution for convection diffusion equation with only zero order terms with constant coefficients and Neuman boundary conditions
3. Verification of solution for convection diffusion equation with first and zeroth order terms with constant coefficient and Dirichlet boundary conditions
4. Verification of solution for convection diffusion equation with first and zeroth order terms with variable coefficients mixed Boundary Conditions
